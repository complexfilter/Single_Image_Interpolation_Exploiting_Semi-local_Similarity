# Single Image Interpolation Exploiting Semi-local Similarity
This repo reproduces the results in the paper "Single Image Interpolation Exploiting Semi-local Similarity", a ICASSP paper published in 2019 with state-of-the-art performance in model-based single image interpolation.

To produce the results, simply run main.m file in Matlabã€‚ It supports parallel computing by default.

# Single Image Interpolation Exploiting Semi-local Similarity
This repo reproduces the results in the paper "Single Image Interpolation Exploiting Semi-local Similarity", a ICASSP paper published in 2019 with state-of-the-art performance in model-based single image interpolation. The link for viewing the paper is: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8682362. For quickly understand this paper, you can read the slides at https://sigport.org/sites/default/files/docs/Single%20Image%20Interpolation%20Exploiting%20Semi-local%20Similarity.pdf.

To reproduce the results on Table 1, simply run main.m file in Matlabã€‚It supports parallel computing by default.
